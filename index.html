     <h3>Favourite Museum - Missouri Civil War Museum</h3>
     <p>The <b>Missouri Civil War Museum</b>It is a fully recognized 501(c)(3) not-for-profit educational organization. Our organization was incorporated in 2002 for the sole purpose of saving the historic Jefferson Barracks 1905 Post Exchange Building and converting it into what will become<b> Missouri’s largest and finest Civil War museum</b>, library, and educational center. Since our opening in June 2013, we have become one of the <b>largest Civil War Museums in the nation</b> and will be one of the largest Civil War research libraries in the nation as well. Our focus is entirely on Missouri’s role in the American Civil War.</p>
